## 2026-11-08 — P3-E actual DGX 30.43 MiB index parsed, weight_map condition under investigation

**Operator read-only evidence:** `python3 -m scripts.manager.flash_host_assets --json` on DGX observed `model.safetensors.index.json` size **31,907,813 bytes (~30.43 MiB)**, below the 128 MiB cap (134,217,728 bytes). The tool reached `PARSE_SHARD_INDEX` and returned `FLASH_SHARD_INDEX_UNQUALIFIED`. Source code combined three cases into one: a missing/non-dict `weight_map`, an empty map, or a map with **more than 100,000 entries**. No count was in that output; **cause within these three cases not yet resolved**. `indexed_shard_count=0` means no shard enumeration, not model damage or missing shards. Pinned command and prepared `-fp8hybrid` view observed; last actual active service remains 27B :8000.

**New source-only diagnosis:** [135f75c](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/135f75c8cc652ed63b8508d10fcf5f079dff24ef) adds redacted `index_weight_map_structure` (OBJECT or MISSING_OR_WRONG_TYPE), `index_weight_map_entry_count_observed`, `index_weight_map_entry_limit` and three distinct bounded errors. **100,000 count cap unchanged** until a real count and intended NVFP4/ModelOpt profile are evidenced; no automatic relaxing, downloading, cache modification or Docker operations. GitHub Actions [42392277467](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/actions/runs/42392277467) **878/878 CPU/Fake-DGX PASS, 39 groups**, 2 new tests. No hardware run of this new code yet.

**Next DGX read-only action:** `git pull --ff-only origin feature/recipe-wizard-handoff` then `python3 -m scripts.manager.flash_host_assets --json`; evaluate `index_weight_map_entry_count_observed`, `index_weight_map_structure`, `failure_reason_code`. If entry count is above limit, review bounded parser memory and stable ModelOpt index before targeted policy change. Do not assume 31MB index is corrupt or change HF cache. Flash canonical reinstall remains `false`, launch disabled, generic lifecycle unreleased, historical real P3-G PASS/CLOSED, P8 deliberate fault/auto-recovery/final acceptance NOT_RUN.

## 2026-11-08 — Actual DGX Flash shard-index cap identified; bounded source fix

**Actual DGX read-only result:** `python3 -m scripts.manager.flash_host_assets --json` returned `BLOCKED`, `failed_stage=READ_SHARD_INDEX`, `failure_reason_code=FILE_EXCEEDS_BOUNDED_READ`. The pinned command identity and `-fp8hybrid` prepared view matched; no model shard contents were examined because `model.safetensors.index.json` exceeded the generic 8 MiB metadata cap. **Actual index byte size is still unknown** and zero recorded shards means unchecked, not missing/corrupt. No DGX GPU or Docker mutation, 27B service remains the last observed active :8000.

**GitHub SOURCE fix:** [56d39e4](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/56d39e4acb5d4e69777372283fe5f8839a16fc7c) uses separate **128 MiB hard cap for index only**, 8 MiB config/tokenizer_config cap, 256 KiB template cap; files are bounded at read time (`read(limit+1)`) to prevent stat/read growth bypass. Adds sanitized numeric `index_file_size_bytes_observed`/`index_file_size_limit_bytes`. Tests cover >8 MiB valid JSON and exceeding index cap. GitHub Actions [42391564016](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/actions/runs/42391564016) **SUCCESS 876/876 CPU/Fake-DGX, 39 groups** (874 previous + 2 new). This is *not* new DGX asset or GPU validation.

**Next read-only operator step:** `git pull --ff-only origin feature/recipe-wizard-handoff` followed by `python3 -m scripts.manager.flash_host_assets --json`. Observe numeric index size and full staged status. If blocked again, investigate actual `failed_stage` and `failure_reason_code` before altering limits or files. Do **not** change HF caches, start/stop/reinstall/switch models, or inject failures without new explicit consent. Flash canonical reinstall NOT QUALIFIED; P3-F lifecycle release OFF, P3-G real bidirectional PASS historically CLOSED, P8 NOT_RUN.

## 2026-11-08 — P3-E real DGX Flash host asset preflight blocked; diagnostic patch/source CI

**Actual operator DGX evidence, no Docker mutation:** `python3 -m scripts.manager.flash_host_assets --json` returned `status=BLOCKED`, issue `FLASH_HOST_ASSET_PREFLIGHT:ValueError`, `legacy_hf_bind_writable=true`, `indexed_shard_count=0`, `metadata_sha256={}`, `template_sha256=null`, `verified_model_revision=true`. This only establishes that the **old observer** advanced past pinned command/env/cache bind, then raised a ValueError during an unidentified local-file validation step. Neither zero shards nor `verified_model_revision=true` proves a missing model or verified revision bytes. **No user-provided evidence of broken inference or failed reinstall.**

**Source fix, not live DGX proof:** [9beb1d3](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/9beb1d3f73675ac4a22daedfc2167b380742305c) adds allowlisted `failed_stage`, `failure_reason_code`, `pinned_command_identity_matched`, `prepared_view_path_observed`, and stops falsely setting `verified_model_revision=true` from a directory name alone. Private exception messages/path/env values are never emitted. Tests cover metadata cap, malformed index, empty/missing/escaped marker, secret exception redaction. GitHub Actions [42391221418](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/actions/runs/42391221418) **SUCCESS: 874/874 CPU/Fake-DGX tests across 39 groups** (previous 870 + 4). Real DGX did not run this patch yet.

**Next safe operator command:** `git pull --ff-only origin feature/recipe-wizard-handoff`; then `python3 -m scripts.manager.flash_host_assets --json`. Inspect only redacted `failed_stage` and `failure_reason_code`. No cache repairs, container recreation, GPU activity or permissions escalation should follow from this result without separate evidence/approval. Flash canonical reinstall remains unqualified, lifecycle release disabled, historic P3-G real PASS/CLOSED and P8 NOT_RUN; preserve 27B at :8000.

## 2026-11-08 — P3-D latest current PID proof and P3-E/F source follow-up

Operator's latest DGX read-only `--sudo-ss` P3-D/E/F/G output: **P3-D READ_ONLY_PASS**, independently attributed docker-proxy IPv4 PID `2560693` and IPv6 PID `2560708`, GPU PID `2560905`, no detected GPU ownership conflict. **P3-E DRAFT_REVIEW_REQUIRED** despite `cmd_normalized=true` using `FLASH_FP8HYBRID_READ_ONLY_V1`, `cmd_normalization_error=null`, draft-field `issues=[]`, because canonical reinstall remains unqualified. **P3-F 153/153 DGX-local CPU PASS**. P3-G preview in this particular runner does not invalidate previously completed real bidirectional G. `blocked_stages=[]` with total `DRAFT_PARTIAL_ACCEPTANCE_NOT_RELEASED` is expected.

GitHub source: [03cbe4c](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/03cbe4cc45a750322c4f99616c85f1061f7b2288), [2b44ccc](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/2b44ccc0237fa34742e28608ad089cb3ca90fe55), and [8e8fcec](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/8e8fcec5acb280e01445a2bd773fc9f4ecedf2f6). Source-only CI [42390619936](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/actions/runs/42390619936): **870/870 PASS, 39 groups**, including 5 new Flash host asset tests. **No acceptance promotion**: P3-D latest READ_ONLY_PASS on real DGX, P3-E still source draft/no canonical reinstall, P3-F local 153 CPU test PASS but production executor blocked; P3-G prior independent real both-direction transfer PASS/CLOSED. P8 deliberate fault/recovery and final go-live NOT_RUN. The new host asset command has not yet been run on DGX and must not mark E as qualified from CI alone.

## Source-only addendum — 2026-11-08 (P3-E/F hardening)

Source change: [d68106a](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/commit/d68106a24c4c6071acff7a4d98d74e04c6ecbfe1). Actual GitHub Actions [42386939625](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/actions/runs/42386939625): **862/862 PASS in 38 CPU/Fake-DGX groups** (856 baseline + 6 new). This is **SOURCE-ONLY**; no fresh DGX test or service change. Full scope: `docs/P3-E-F-SOURCE-HARDENING-20261108.md`.

Acceptance milestones **unchanged**: P3-E `DRAFT_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, no qualified Flash canonical reinstall; P3-F `SOURCE_CPU_PASS_NOT_RELEASED`, generic lifecycle execution blocked; P3-G `REAL BIDIRECTIONAL PASS / CLOSED` from original operator DGX receipts; P8 `NOT_RUN / NOT_RELEASED`. No new DGX runtime/rollback/benchmark measurement or production release.

## 2026-11-07 — AUDITED P3-A–G; G CLOSED, FAILURE/FINAL RELEASE REASSIGNED TO P8

**Latest acceptance audit:** `docs/P3-A-G-EVIDENCE-AUDIT-20261107.md`. Historical **A/B/C REAL PASS/CLOSED** (Flash→27B, 27B→Flash, Flash→27B; immutable original receipts); **D REAL READ_ONLY_PASS** for single GPU and independently attributed IPv4/IPv6 host :8000 process ownership (measured before most recent roundtrip); **E DRAFT_REVIEW_REQUIRED** despite confirmed NVIDIA Flash `-fp8hybrid` source variant and source-draft documented-field match because **canonical reinstall-qualified Flash recipe is NOT registered or real tested**; **F 144/144 local Fake-DGX/CPU PASS** with production lifecycle release still OFF; **G REAL BIDIRECTIONAL PASS/CLOSED**, two separately authorized 27B→Flash→27B live transfers, current last observed 27B API `qwen3.8-27b`, `diff=[]`, journal `VERIFIED/COMMITTED` 28 events. **P3-A~G aggregate is NOT fully complete because E remains OPEN and F is only source-qualified.** Don't replay A/B/C/G. The operator reclassified deliberate fault injection, automatic source restoration and final production/UX signoff exclusively as **P8**, which is `NOT_RUN/NOT_RELEASED` and does not block G's closed successful-transfer scope. P7 remains component integration only. Source-only CI after P8 registration: [42384120480](https://github.com/kjlee-inlct/qwen3.8-Flash-DGX/actions/runs/42384120480) SUCCESS, **856/856 CPU tests / 38 groups**; that does not evidence new DGX runtime results.

P3-E remains the sole currently open *canonical reinstall qualification* among A-G; P3-F CPU suite accepted as source-only scope but generic lifecycle remains locked pending distinct operational authorization. P8 final Go/No-Go and recovery must not be backfilled from G.

# P1–P8 Wizard acceptance status — canonical milestone scope (2026-11-07)

> This document supersedes phase **scope** and status headings in the older historical `docs/P1-P7-WIZARD-ACCEPTANCE-STATUS-20261107.md`; it does **not** alter immutable execution receipts or rewrite historical evidence. All live statuses below reflect the last **operator-provided** DGX output, not a new probe from GitHub.

## Scope and current status

| Phase | Acceptance objective | Current evidence classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | NVIDIA Flash-Next source/runtime/API/benchmark | Prior real DGX P1 checks passed; refer to prior immutable records |
| P2 | NVIDIA 27B pinned download/start/API/native tool calling/benchmark | Prior real DGX P2 checks passed; canonical 27B recipe SHA preserved |
| P3-A/B/C | Original one-off stage sequence; exact receipts | **REAL PASS / CLOSED** |
| P3-D | Exclusive GPU process and host port-8000 PID provenance | **READ_ONLY_PASS** on real DGX with explicitly opted-in `sudo -n ss` |
| P3-E | Flash runtime provenance, canonical reinstall-ready recipe | **DRAFT_REVIEW_REQUIRED**: pinned `-fp8hybrid` snapshot and documented draft fields matched, but canonical reinstall unqualified |
| P3-F | Generic lifecycle operations' CPU/Fake-DGX source gates | **SOURCE_CPU_PASS_NOT_RELEASED**; last supplied local batch 144/144 PASS |
| **P3-G** | **Real 27B↔Flash-Next successful independent bidirectional operating transfers, API/journal and canonical recipe postchecks** | **REAL PASS / CLOSED** — two separate DGX TTY-authorized switches and reverse 27B `diff=[]` |
| P4 | Optional Flash storage cleanup/reinstall disposition | Optional; NOT_APPLICABLE may be chosen if no need for deletion |
| P5 | Orcarouter deployment/API/bench | PENDING |
| P6 | Orcarouter↔27B real transfer | PENDING |
| **P7** | **Service/proxy/gateway integration and numerical/CI qualification** | PENDING; **does not include final signoff** |
| **P8** | **Deliberate controlled fault injection, automatic source restoration real verification, final operating UX/security/production release signoff** | **NOT_RUN / NOT_RELEASED** |

## Real P3-G bidirectional evidence

1. `27b → flash-next`: independent execution SHA `365099fea62bc06bb78006bbf66ef93670cf3ec72d7d50202afe23395c8a3654`, operator `PASS`, Flash served API `qwen3.8-flash-next`, journal `VERIFIED/COMMITTED`, 21 events.
2. `flash-next → 27b`: independent execution SHA `a909a1470760613b3d8e1f588dada06a41205ceac7e07c5ff464eac01884ed8b`, operator `PASS`, 27B served API `qwen3.8-27b`, journal `VERIFIED/COMMITTED`, 28 events. 27B canonical recipe diff `[]`, issues `[]`. Source: `docs/P3-G-LIVE-BIDIRECTIONAL-SWITCH-PASS-20261107.md`.

**Current last-observed running model**: NVIDIA 27B, host port 8000; one managed model according to manifest-led service check. The `gpu_exclusivity_verified=false` and `port_process_ownership_verified=false` of the basic status command mean that command doesn't independently audit those properties, not that collisions were observed.

**P3-G completion is limited to successful two-way transfers**, not claim of fault-tolerance under injected failure. P3-E Flash reinstall recipe qualification, P3-F general lifecycle/production dispatch and P8 release remain independently pending. No forced error, deletion, image/cache purge or irreversible service change is authorized by phase renumbering.

## P8 safety contract

P8-A fault matrix and live bounds; P8-B Fake-DGX recovery/journal and negative tests; P8-C independently approved DGX bounded failure and verified **automatic source restoration**; P8-D full Wizard final integrated operations/UX/security and go-live signoff. Details `docs/P8-FAULT-RECOVERY-FINAL-OPERATIONS-ACCEPTANCE-PLAN-20261107.md`.

A successful *source-only* P8 plan or Fake-DGX tests **cannot** mark P8-C or P8-D PASS, cannot set `production_released=true`, and cannot dispatch Docker/GPU fault injection. The new Wizard P8 menu is deliberately `INTERFACE_ONLY / BLOCKED`.

## Handoff rule

Future work on P4–P7 may proceed without reopening P3-G. P8 remains the dedicated safety/end-to-end acceptance milestone. Preserve old DGX switch receipts, preserve model files/HF cache and vLLM 0.32/API 8000/ONE_ACTIVE_MODEL_ONLY rules; do not use SGLang. PR #1 stays Draft/unmerged until a separate release decision.
