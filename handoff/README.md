# Handoff index — START HERE

**Canonical starting point for every new ChatGPT, human or agent work session on this fork.** These files live on the **new planning branch** `feature/recipe-wizard-handoff` until merged. Do not assume they are on `main`.

## Read order (mandatory)

1. **[CURRENT-STATE.md](CURRENT-STATE.md)** — latest known project, branch/HEAD, active stage, blockers and verification status.
2. **[OPERATING-RULES.md](OPERATING-RULES.md)** — do-not-touch boundary, evidence standards, update obligations.
3. **[NEXT-ACTIONS.md](NEXT-ACTIONS.md)** — tasks in priority order and exit conditions.
4. **[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)** — fixed decisions vs proposals.
5. **[EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md](EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md)** — what was actually tested, source vs DGX.
6. **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** — append-only significant updates.
7. **[../docs/MODEL-RECIPE-WIZARD-PLAN.md](../docs/MODEL-RECIPE-WIZARD-PLAN.md)** and **[../docs/MANIFEST-CONTRACTS.md](../docs/MANIFEST-CONTRACTS.md)** — scope, staging, interfaces and cleanup contract.

Use [SESSION-START-PROMPT.md](SESSION-START-PROMPT.md) for a new conversation. Do not paste full context repeatedly if GitHub can be read.

## Source-of-truth hierarchy

1. Fresh **read-only actual DGX evidence** and verified GitHub refs/CI (for runtime/git facts).
2. `CURRENT-STATE.md` and `EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md` (for previously observed facts; preserve timestamps).
3. Reviewed committed plan, contracts and decisions.
4. Legacy Preview/YSLAB documents and earlier chat summaries (historical context, **not** proof of this fork).
5. Assumptions must be labelled `UNVERIFIED`; no upgrade to PASS without evidence.

When refs disagree, do not silently merge/overwrite: record the discrepancy, refresh with tools and fix source documents in the same PR.

## Handoff closing checklist

On any session that changes GitHub, documents, tests, requirements or verified state:
- commit implementation and documentation, or record precisely why they cannot be committed;
- update `CURRENT-STATE.md` and `NEXT-ACTIONS.md` **in the same change set**; update ledger/decisions/changelog if affected;
- refresh actual branch, commit, PR and CI status using GitHub tool; never write a self-referential “this file contains its own HEAD” claim;
- include exact commands, what ran, test results, artifact/log links, what did **not** run, next safe action;
- open or update PR as appropriate; **do not merge merely because documentation exists**;
- end with a short handoff summary linking these files.

`CURRENT-STATE.md` is a **living snapshot**, not a history. Put the history in `CHANGELOG.md` and evidence in `EVIDENCE-LEDGER.md`. No secrets or credentials in these files. File and branch names are stable interfaces for future sessions.
